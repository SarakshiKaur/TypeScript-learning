WHAT IS TYPESCRIPT?
=> TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
=> It is developed by Microsoft.
=> It is essentially JavaScript with the addition of type annotations and static type checking
   , allowing developers to catch errors at compile-time rather than at runtime. 
   This helps address one of the main limitations of JavaScript.
=> Remember, TypeScript is a development tool, not a separate programming language. 
   The TypeScript code is ultimately compiled into regular JavaScript before it runs, 
   ensuring compatibility with existing JavaScript environments.

GLOBALLY INSTALLING TYPESCRIPT
=> via npm
   You can use npm to install TypeScript globally, this means that you can use the 
   tsc command anywhere in your terminal.
   To do this, run npm install -g typescript.
=> Check version with command, tsc -v

RUN TS FILE 
=> You can compile a TypeScript file with the command, tsc filename.ts
   This will create a new JavaScript file with the same name but with a .js extension.
   You can then run the JavaScript file with Node.js.



SOME BEHAVIOURS OF TS THAT I AM LEARNING
=> TypeScript is based on a STRUCTURAL TYPE SYSTEM, which means that when you create a custom type 
   with specific properties (e.g., two keys, each having a string type), TypeScript will check if 
   the object passed to a function has at least the required properties with the correct types.
   However, TypeScript does not enforce exact matches. If the object has additional properties 
   beyond those defined in the type, it will not show an error as long as the required properties 
   are present and their types are correct.
   
   In other words, TypeScript only cares about the properties specified in the type 
   and ensures they are correct. It does not check for extra properties that are not mentioned 
   in the type.

   For an example, please refer to the file objects/objects.ts.
