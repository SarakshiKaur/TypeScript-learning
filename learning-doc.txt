WHAT IS TYPESCRIPT?
=> TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
=> It is developed by Microsoft.
=> It is essentially JavaScript with the addition of type annotations and static type checking
   , allowing developers to catch errors at compile-time rather than at runtime. 
   This helps address one of the main limitations of JavaScript.
=> Remember, TypeScript is a development tool, not a separate programming language. 
   The TypeScript code is ultimately compiled into regular JavaScript before it runs, 
   ensuring compatibility with existing JavaScript environments.

GLOBALLY INSTALLING TYPESCRIPT
=> via npm
   You can use npm to install TypeScript globally, this means that you can use the 
   tsc command anywhere in your terminal.
   To do this, run npm install -g typescript.
=> Check version with command, tsc -v
